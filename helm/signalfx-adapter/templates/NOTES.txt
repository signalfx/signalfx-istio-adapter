The SignalFx Istio adapter has been deployed.  You should see spans in SignalFx
momentarily assuming everything is setup properly.

If you do not see spans, you can check logs on the adapter by running:

$ kubectl logs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "signalfx-istio.name" . }}
